# Assets Directory

This directory should contain extracted assets from the Ultima Online client.

## Quick Start

The game will work without assets (using placeholder graphics), but for the authentic UO experience, you need to extract assets from your UO client installation.

## Required Assets

### Sprites
Place character, weapon, and spell effect sprites in:
- `sprites/characters/male/` - Character animations
- `sprites/weapons/` - Weapon graphics
- `sprites/effects/` - Spell effect animations

### UI Elements
Place UI graphics in:
- `ui/` - Health bars, mana bars, paperdoll backgrounds

### Tiles
Place ground/arena tiles in:
- `tiles/` - Arena floor tiles

### Sounds
Place audio files in:
- `sounds/weapons/` - Weapon swing and hit sounds
- `sounds/spells/` - Spell casting and impact sounds
- `sounds/character/` - Character death and hit sounds
